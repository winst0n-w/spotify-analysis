# spotify-analysis

I listen to music all the time and one thing I always look forward to is Spotify’s year-end summary and seeing that year’s stats and my favorite artists and tracks.

I discovered that you can use Spotify’s API to extract information about your Spotify profile. To build upon the Python skills I learned in school, I decided to use the Python library, Spotipy, to write a script to extract information on some of my playlists and its tracks. Along with the tracks, I also analyzed the track features that Spotify offers such as danceability, energy, valence, etc.

Some questions I wanted to answer were:

* Who are my favorite artists?
* What type of music do I listen to? (in terms of the different features Spotify has)
* How does my music taste change over time?
* How do my playlists differ from each other?
